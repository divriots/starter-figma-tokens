# Starter Figma Tokens

This starter kit is for users that want to use [Figma Tokens Plugin](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/843461159747178978/Figma-Tokens) in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) as a starting point to build their Design System.
This kit shows an automated workflow, where your design tokens source of truth is in the Figma Tokens Plugin.
Whenever you update the tokens and push to GitHub, the coded components inside Backlight will automatically update, in a Pull Request!
